					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hi!! My name is Angelina Flum. Angelina like the ballerina mouse and Flum like the Vape, but I go by Angie. I'm a 3rd year intensive psychology major who still needs to fufill a math requirnment. I've never coded in my life but my dad is a computer engineer so I grew up around "CSS+ For Dummies." I'm a preschool teacher at the childcare center on campus, and I've also been getting really into stick and pokes and just gave myself a couple new ones! </p>
