			<h1>Hello World</h1>
					<p>Angie has bright red hair that is defenitley natural. She's a preschool teacher and really hate olives. She is an intensive psychology major and this is her first time ever writing code! YIPEE! Artem is  </p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problems that arose mainly had to do with just figuring out how to do this for the first time. It was less about actual obstacles we ran into and more about learning as we went. The biggest harship was just starting and getting a flow going, after that, it started to make more sense and became easier. </p>
			<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It went pretty good after the initial hurdles! Once we were more comftorable and familiar with what we were doing it became kind of fun! Its like a game once you really get going. The most amount of effort was put into figuring out what everything meant and where to put the specific lines of code. We also put a significant amount of effort into actually teaching ourselves what everything meant and not just what we needed to know for the assignment.  </p>
